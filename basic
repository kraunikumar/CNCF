Link of 
  - compute and storage
  - Infra-as-service ( need Devops engineers)
    - Too much OPS
    - Migration is painfull
  - Platform-as-service ( no need of devops engineers )
    - Lock-in to cloud provider
    - Less control over infra
 
 What is a container ?
 Features of kubernetes :
 Auto-healing: crashed containers should restart.
 Auto-scaling: More cilents more demand
 Load-balancing: Distributed client request
 Isolation: Sandboxes so that containers don't interfer
 
 
 
 Volumes:
 Epmtydir 
  - lifertime : pod
  
  cloud Volumes: 
    - aws: EBS only
    - AZURe: azureDisk, azureFile
    - GCP: gcePersistentDisk
    
 Kubernetes native volumes:
 secreat
 consfigmap
 gitrepo
 
 
Persistant volume provinisioning :
static : admin need to creat volume.
dynamic : stotageclass -> Claim


types of volumes:
emptyDir:
  - shared directory for all the container inside the pod.
  - Scratch space, checkingpointing
Configmap
   it constines list of key value pairs, can be refference in a volume and volume can be refferenced by cntainers running inside the pod
   
gitrepo
hostpath:-
  Mount file/dictory from host into the pod
  usecase : docekr internals, cadvisor, weather the host path exsists befor volume come into exsistance.
  
secret:
  pass secreat info to pods
  secret volumes are backed by RAM based file system which ensures the conters are never written to non volital storage
  Base 64 enconding: echo -n 'my-app' | base64
  it has only base 64 strings.
